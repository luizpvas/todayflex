Pretending pencil and paper

My original goal with Todayflex was to mimic pen and paper experience.
The freedom and flexibility to draw anything, to express ideas with
words, drawings and arrows. The semi chaotic experience of grouping
related stuff in the bottom right corner. The tactile control we
have to express something **BIG AND BOLD AND IMPORTANT** or a
*small note in the corner*.

Organizing our day-to-day with handwritten tools have drawbacks, of course.
Things might get out of control, we might forget ideas/reminders because we
simply forgot to look at them, we can lose the paper and its personal, like
**really** personal.

When bringing this experience to software, I came to the conclusion that it
was impossible to fully bring the freedom and flexibility and speed of
writing, but specially drawing with pen to a mouse or trackpad. It's just not
as good enough, so trying to mimic pen and paper was never going to feel right.

Freedom and flexibility are important. The ability to quickly sketch an idea
is important. Grouping related things visually is important.  Looking like a
paper texture is not important. Using a handwritten font is not important.

With all this in mind, I came to the following design points:

* Infinite canvas in all directions to not limit or loose context of existing
  content.
* Every text is indexed and available for search.
* Everything you see on canvas can be moved, scaled, deleted, duplicated or
  referenced. The usual controls you expect from any image manipulation software.
