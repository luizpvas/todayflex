How can a single developer compete with large teams?

My first instinct is to answer "no, a single developer can't compete".
A possible but useless answer is "by being special".

But the focus shouldn't be on people (single developer or small team vs large teams)
but on the product.

There are a category of products small teams just **can't** compete with large teams.
If your software requires a physics engine, a rendering engine, animation controls,
particle simulations and a scripting language in order to be finished (I'm talking
about game engines) then it's going to be veeery dificult to compete with a team
of specialized developers that can work in paralel in each of those areas.

## Features as permutations

When adding a feature to a product we should be looking for permutations.
