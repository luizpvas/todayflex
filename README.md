# Todayflex is last organization app you'll ever need.

All productitivies app are subjective.

Trello works for some people. Basecamp works for some people. Jira doesn't work for most people.

The overall problem we're all trying to solve is:

> How can I get something done in a organized way so that I can have confidence I'll finish it in the agreed time?

There are 4 things to unpack in this sentence:

* "get something done"
* "organized way"
* "confidence"
* "agreed time"
