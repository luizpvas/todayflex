        <h1>About Todayflex</h1>

        <p>Most apps are built around projects or tasks. Those are things that
        people can jump in and out.</p>

        <p>Todayflex is about you, the person doing the work - and in that sense
        we're closer to a journal than a project management software.</p>

        <p>Todayflex is organized in days, each day at a time. "Today" is the
        most important day, it's when things are happening: you're writing about
        things you need to remember, you're creating tasks about stuff you'll do
        later, you're pasting screenshots to capture the progress.</p>

        <p>When the work period is ending, we usually start to slow down and think
        about the next day: what we couldn't finish that we'll do tomorrow, ideas
        that are worth keeping, ideas that are not so interesting and should be
        archived.</p>

        <h2>About the business</h2>

        <p>I have no idea how to run a business, I just wanted to create something.</p>

        <p>Todayflex is open-source, so if anything happens to me you can always host it yourself. But it's
        a lot of work to do it right, and there's how I'll (hopefully) make money to support this project.</p>

        <p>When you purchase Todayflex you're essentially paying for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hosting (servers, backup, security and automatic updates).</li>
          <li>Support further improvements, new features and bug fixes.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I've seen so many apps fail or just go offline - what if this happens to Todayflex?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Todayflex is open-source, so you can always host it yourself. You can also export your data
        and import into any running instance which makes Todayflex <b>reaaally</b> flexible.</p>

        <p>Hopefully that eases your mind üòÅ.</p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">About the tech</h2>

        <p>Here are the main technologies used to build this software:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Digital Ocean Droplets for hosting.</li>
          <li>Digital Ocean Spaces for file storage.</li>
          <li>Postgres for storing pretty much everything expect files.</li>
          <li>Phoenix for the backend.</li>
          <li>Elm for the editor. This is the only piece I couldn't see myself using anything else.</li>
          <li>AlpineJS for simple interactive elements in this website</li>
        </ul>
